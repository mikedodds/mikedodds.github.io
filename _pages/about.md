I'm a Principal Scientist at [Galois, Inc](https://galois.com), a private research consultancy based in Portland OR. Galois specializes in formal methods, programming languages, and systems assurance. 

I'm mostly interested in the real-world applications of formal methods: 

* 'Formal methods': My work applies mathematical reasoning to ensure software is secure, correct, and bug-free. I'm interested in solving problems in high-impact domains like cryptography, distributed systems, concurrency, and hardware semantics. 
* 'Real-world': I'm interested in building tools that can be deployed in software engineering environments. This means building powerful, reliable, and understandable tools that complement existing engineering workflows. 

Some projects I'm involved with: 

* [CN](https://rems-project.github.io/cn-tutorial/), a unified testing and verification tool for real C code. 
* [Daedalus](https://galoisinc.github.io/daedalus/), a safe parsing language we developed on the DARPA SafeDocs project. We used Daedalus to build a reference PDF parser for the PDF association. 
* [c2rust](https://c2rust.com), a transpiler from C to Rust which is used for several popular Rust crates. 
* Verified cryptography with our tools [SAW](https://saw.galois.com) and [Cryptol](https://cryptol.net). I've worked (amongst others) with AWS, including verifying core bits of the [AWS-LibCrypto library](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc-verification). 

My career history: 
* 2004-2008: PhD student in [the University of York, UK](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk), working with [Detlef Plump](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~djp10/). 
* 2008-2012: Postdoc in the [Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk), working with [Matthew Parkinson](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mattpark/) and [Peter Sewell](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/). 
* 2012-2017: Lecturer (approximately, [an associate professor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_ranks_in_the_United_Kingdom)) in [the University of York, UK](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk). 
* 2017-present: Principal Scientist at [Galois, Inc](https://galois.com).
