I am a Principal Scientist at [Galois, Inc](https://galois.com), a private research consultancy based in Portland OR. Galois specializes in formal methods, programming languages, and systems assurance. 

Some projects I'm involved with: 

* [CN](https://rems-project.github.io/cn-tutorial/), a unified testing and verification tool for real C code. 
* [Daedalus](https://galoisinc.github.io/daedalus/), a safe parsing language we developed on the DARPA SafeDocs project. We used Daedalus to build a reference PDF parser for the PDF association. 
* [c2rust](https://c2rust.com), a transpiler from C to Rust which is used for several popular Rust crates. 
* Verified cryptography with our tools [SAW](https://saw.galois.com) and [Cryptol](https://cryptol.net). I've worked (amongst others) with AWS, including verifying core bits of the [AWS-LibCrypto library](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc-verification).
