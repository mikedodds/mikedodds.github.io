**Abstract:** C programs that manipulate list-based dynamic data structures remain a challenging target for static verification. In this paper we employ the dynamic analysis of dsOli to locate and identify data structure operations in a program, and then use this information to automatically annotate that program with assertions in separation logic. These annotations comprise candidate pre/post-conditions and loop in- variants suitable to statically verify memory safety with the verification tool VeriFast. By using both textbook and real-world examples on our prototype implementation, we show that the generated assertions are often discharged automatically. Even when this is not the case, candidate invariants are of great help to the verification engineer, significantly reducing the manual verification effort.
