**Abstract:** This paper discusses black-hat and hat-nonterm, two tools for
locating and diagnosing non-termination errors in Haskell programs. Both of
these tools give a small trace which is intended to illuminate the cause of the
non-termination error. black-hat analyses programs which contain black holes,
a particularly restricted kind of non-termination error, while hat-nonterm
applies the approach used in black-hat to more general non-terminating
programs. This paper discusses the traces generated by black-hat and
hat-nonterm, as well as the approach used to generate these traces.
